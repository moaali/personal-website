It is used to create a global-scoped or block-scoped variable whose refrence **can't** be re-assigned and it can't be re-declared in the same scope.\n\n\n\n##### Syntax\n\n```javascript\nconst IDENTIFIER = expression; // Assignment is a must\n```\n\n\n\n\n##### Notes\n\n1. `const` creates global-scoped & block-scoped variable contrary to `var` that creates global-scoped & **function-scoped** only, same as `let`.\n2. `const` doesn't create properties on global object contrary to `var`, same as `let`.\n3. `const` allows only a single declaration for a sepecific identifier within the same scope. redeclaring the same variable created by `const` within the same scope throws a `SyntaxError`. re-assigment of the same identifier at any scope throws a `TypeError`.\n4. `const` allows you to delete/write/edit the assigned object.\n5. `const` assignment (a.k.a: intialzation) is **a must** meaninig you **can't** do this `const x;` contrary to `let`.\n6. `const` gets hoisted but it can't be accessed within the **Temporal Dead Zone** (a.k.a: **TDZ**) means you can't reference the identifier before or within the declaration statement or `RefrenceError` is thrown;\n\n- Common practice when using `const`: capitalize all identifier letters and in case multiple words identifier use `_` as separator.\n\n```javascript\n// [ Item 1 ]\nconst X = 0; // global-scoped\nfunction fn() {\n  const Y = 1; // function-scoped also block-scoped\n  if ( Y === 1 ) {\n    const Z = 2; // block-scoped\n  }\n}\n\n\n// [ Item 2 ]\nconst X = 0;\nwindow.X; // undefined not 0\n\n\n// [ Item 3 ]\nconst X = 0;\nconst X = 1; // SyntaxError\nX = 1; // TypeError: re-assigment is not allowed\n\nconst Y = 1;\nif ( true ) {\n  Y = 2; // TypeError: re-assigment is not allowed\n  const Y = 2; // Totally valid\n}\n\n\n// [ Item 4 ]\nconst ARR = [1, 2];\nARR.push(3);    // Valid: ARR = [1, 2, 3]\ndelete ARR[0];  // Valid: ARR = [undefined, 2, 3]\nARR[0] = 'ONE'; // Valid: ARR = ['ONE', 2, 3]\n\n\n// [ Item 6 ]\nconst X = 0;\n\nconst FN = function () {\n  return x;\n  const X = 1; // Error below asserts that x is hoisted\n};\n\nFN() // RefrenceError\n```\n\n##### Practical Usage\n- Use `const` whereever you don't need to re-assign the same identifier to a different value, otherwise use `let`.\n"}});
